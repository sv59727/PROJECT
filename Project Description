# PROJECT
In this project i have walk through step by step process to make a cryto currency tracker app. It is android application . In this app i have displayed the different cryptocurrency present in the crypto market along with the search functionality. I have used volley as a library for parsing the Json data from the API. And apart from this in this application  we will get to see the different crypto currencies along with it's symbol, rate and it's named and in search tab we can search and find any crypto currencies that is present in cryto exchange.

-> Inside this application  i have fatching data from Json file and for fatching the data from Json file i have used  volley as  library.
-> Then i add the dependency in build.gradle section  implementation 'com.android.volley:volley:1.1.1'.
-> Inside the application as i fetch data from webAPI so I added a permission for internet to use the internet in menifest folder.
-> I have creating the API key by using CoinMarketCap. After generating the link of API i paste it in PostMan to get API testing.
-> Postman is an application used for API testing.
-> What is volley?
Volley is an HTTP library that makes networking very easy and fast, for Android apps. It was developed because there is an absence in Android SDK, of a networking class capable of working without interfering with the user experience. Although Volley is a part of the Android Open Source Project Google announced in January 2017 that Volley will move to a standalone library. It manages the processing and caching of network requests and it saves developers valuable time from writing the same network call/cache code again and again.Volley is not suitable for large download or streaming operations since Volley holds all responses in memory during parsing.
-> Idea of this project is that currently the the market of the crypto currency is all time high and also many people want to invest there money and they need a light weight app to analysis the market and also the crypto currency is very trending among our youth so this app provides them all the information they want. And this is the main reason to build the app.
