# PROJECT
In this project i have walk through step by step process to make a cryto currency tracker app. It is android application . In this app i have displayed the different cryptocurrency present in the crypto market along with the search functionality. I have used volley as a library for parsing the Json data from the API. And apart from this in this application  we will get to see the different crypto currencies along with it's symbol, rate and it's named and in search tab we can search and find any crypto currencies that is present in cryto exchange.

-> Inside this application  i have fatching data from Json file and for fatching the data from Json file i have used  volley as  library.
-> Then i add the dependency in build.gradle section  implementation 'com.android.volley:volley:1.1.1'.
-> Inside the application as i fetch data from webAPI so I added a permission for internet to use the internet in menifest folder.
-> I have creating the API key by using CoinMarketCap. After generating the link of API i paste it in PostMan to get API testing.
-> Postman is an application used for API testing.
